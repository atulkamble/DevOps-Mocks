## **ðŸ”¹ Section 2: CI/CD & Automation Questions**  
### **4. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?**  
âœ… **Answer:**  
CI is a **practice of frequently integrating code** into a shared repository. Developers push small code changes, and automated tests run to catch errors early.  

**Tools used:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, AWS CodeBuild

### **6. How do you set up a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins?**  
âœ… **Answer:**  
1. Install **Jenkins** and required plugins (Git, Docker, Pipeline).  
2. Configure **source code repository** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).  
3. Create a **Jenkinsfile** with steps for build, test, and deployment:  
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps { sh 'mvn clean package' }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps { sh 'mvn test' }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps { sh './deploy.sh' }
           }
       }
   }
   ```  
4. Configure **Jenkins job** to trigger on code commits.  
5. Run the pipeline and monitor the process.

## **ðŸ”¹ Section 3: Containers & Kubernetes Questions**  
### **7. What is Docker, and why is it used?**  
âœ… **Answer:**  
Docker is a **containerization tool** that allows you to package applications and dependencies into portable containers.  

**Benefits:**  
- Eliminates **dependency issues**  
- Works across **different environments**  
- Enables **scalability and fast deployments**  

---

### **8. How do you create a Docker container for a Node.js app?**  
âœ… **Answer:**  
1. Create a `Dockerfile`:  
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:14
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package.json .
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```
2. Build and run the container:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
   ```  

---

### **9. What is Kubernetes, and how does it work?**  
âœ… **Answer:**  
Kubernetes is a **container orchestration platform** that manages containerized applications across multiple hosts.  

**Key components:**  
- **Pods** â€“ Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.  
- **Deployments** â€“ Ensures desired state of applications.  
- **Services** â€“ Enables communication between pods.  
- **Ingress** â€“ Manages external traffic.  

---

### **10. How do you deploy an application in Kubernetes?**  
âœ… **Answer:**  
1. Create a `deployment.yaml`:  
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
