### **DevOps Scenario-Based Questions and Answers** ðŸš€  

These **scenario-based** DevOps questions will help you test real-world problem-solving skills in CI/CD, automation, containerization, cloud infrastructure, monitoring, and more.

---

### **1. CI/CD Pipeline Failure**  
**Scenario:**  
You are managing a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application. The pipeline fails at the deployment stage with an error:  
> "Permission Denied: Unable to deploy artifacts to the production server."

**Question:**  
What could be the possible reasons for this failure, and how would you resolve it?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Possible reasons:  
- **Insufficient permissions**: The Jenkins service account may not have the necessary SSH or API access to deploy to the production server.  
- **Wrong credentials**: Incorrect or expired authentication credentials for the deployment server.  
- **Security policies**: A firewall or IAM policy may be blocking access.  
- **File ownership issues**: The deployment user does not have write access to the target directory.  

**Solution:**  
- Verify and update **Jenkins credentials** for deployment.  
- Ensure the Jenkins user has the correct **SSH keys** or API tokens.  
- Check **IAM roles and security group rules** in AWS/Azure.  
- Run `chmod` or `chown` to grant necessary **file permissions**.

### **2. Docker Container Exiting Immediately**  
**Scenario:**  
You have created a Docker container for a Python Flask application using:  
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
```
However, the container exits immediately.  

**Question:**  
What could be the cause, and how will you debug and fix this issue?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Possible reasons:  
- The application may have **crashed** due to missing dependencies.  
- The container **does not have a running process** (e.g., missing `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`).  
- The port mapping is incorrect.  

**Solution:**  
- Run `docker logs <container_id>` to check errors.  
- Use `docker ps -a` to see the container status.  
- If it's a process issue, check `CMD` in the Dockerfile:  
  ```Dockerfile
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```
- If dependencies are missing, add them to `requirements.txt` and install them in `Dockerfile`.

### **3. Kubernetes Pod in CrashLoopBackOff**  
**Scenario:**  
A Kubernetes Pod running an Nginx container goes into **CrashLoopBackOff** state.  

**Question:**  
How do you troubleshoot and fix this issue?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Possible reasons:  
- Incorrect **container startup command**.  
- Resource constraints (CPU, Memory).  
- Misconfigured **readiness/liveness probes**.  

**Solution:**  
- Check logs with `kubectl logs <pod_name>`.  
- Describe the pod using `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>`.  
- Verify CPU/memory limits in the YAML file:  
  ```yaml
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "256Mi"
  ```  
- Check **readiness and liveness probes**:  
  ```yaml
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 80
    initialDelaySeconds: 3
    periodSeconds: 5
  ```

### **4. High CPU Utilization on EC2**  
**Scenario:**  
Your web application running on an AWS EC2 instance is experiencing **high CPU usage** and slow performance.  

**Question:**  
How do you identify the issue and optimize performance?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Possible causes:  
- A **memory leak** in the application.  
- High incoming **traffic spikes**.  
- Unoptimized queries or loops consuming CPU.  

**Solution:**  
- Use `htop` or `top` to identify high CPU processes.  
- Check logs with `sudo journalctl -u <service> --since "10m ago"`.  
- Optimize database queries if applicable.  
- Scale out using **AWS Auto Scaling** or increase instance size.  
- Set up **CloudWatch alarms** to monitor CPU utilization.

### **5. Rolling Back a Failed Deployment in Kubernetes**  
**Scenario:**  
A new deployment update to a Kubernetes application caused service downtime.  

**Question:**  
How do you **roll back** to the previous stable version?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Steps to roll back:  
1. Check rollout history:  
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment <deployment-name>
   ```  
2. Roll back to the previous version:  
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>
   ```  
3. Verify the rollback:  
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

### **6. AWS S3 Bucket Access Denied Error**  
**Scenario:**  
Your application tries to access an AWS S3 bucket, but encounters the error:  
> "403 Forbidden - Access Denied"  

**Question:**  
What are possible reasons and how do you resolve it?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Possible reasons:  
- IAM role does not have `s3:ListBucket` permission.  
- The S3 bucket has a restrictive **bucket policy**.  
- The object is encrypted and requires a **KMS decryption** permission.  

**Solution:**  
- Check and update **IAM role** with:  
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
    "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"]
  }
  ```  
- Verify S3 bucket policy using AWS CLI:  
  ```bash
  aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name
  ```  
- Ensure your application has the correct **AWS credentials**.

### **7. Pipeline Takes Too Long to Deploy**  
**Scenario:**  
Your DevOps pipeline is taking **too long to deploy** a simple application.  

**Question:**  
What are the possible causes, and how would you improve the pipeline speed?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Possible reasons:  
- **Long build times** due to unoptimized dependencies.  
- **Too many manual approval steps**.  
- **Large artifacts** slowing down deployments.  

**Optimization:**  
- **Cache dependencies** (e.g., in Docker):  
  ```Dockerfile
  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt --cache-dir /tmp/pip-cache
  ```  
- Use **parallel stages** in Jenkins to speed up builds.  
- Implement **incremental builds** (build only changed parts).  
- Optimize **Docker images** by using lightweight base images.

### **8. Application Logs Not Available in AWS CloudWatch**  
**Scenario:**  
Your application logs are not appearing in **AWS CloudWatch**.  

**Question:**  
What could be wrong, and how do you fix it?  

âœ… **Answer:**  
Possible reasons:  
- CloudWatch Agent is **not installed or running**.  
- Log group or **permissions are missing**.  
- Incorrect log file path in the agent configuration.  

**Solution:**  
- Install and start the CloudWatch Agent:  
  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent
  sudo systemctl start amazon-cloudwatch-agent
  ```  
- Ensure **IAM role** has the required permissions:  
  ```json
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
  }
  ```  
- Check CloudWatch Agent logs:  
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log
  ```
